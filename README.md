### Plugin Information

- This plugin allows you to view and control your Eufy Security devices within HomeKit. The plugin:
  - requires your Eufy Security credentials **(we highly recommend to use [Family/Guest Account](https://support.eufylife.com/s/article/Share-Your-eufySecurity-Devices-With-Your-Family) dedicated to the plugin)**
  - we support Eufy Security OTP validation by email and captcha

### Prerequisites

- To use this plugin, you will need to already have [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) (at least v1.6.1)  installed. Refer to the links for more information and installation instructions.
- For configuration Homebridge UI is recommenend. If you have 2FA enabled it is mandatory.

### ⚠️ Warning
Starting from Node.js versions `18.19.1`, `20.11.1`, and `21.6.2`, the removal of `RSA_PKCS1_PADDING` support breaks Eufy Security's livestream/P2P functionality. We advise against using Node.js versions beyond **v20.11.0** until compatibility with the plugin has been confirmed. If you encounter any issues, consider reverting to the recommended LTS version within the **v20** branch. See [here](https://github.com/homebridge-eufy-security/plugin/wiki/Node.js-Compatibility-with-Eufy-Security-Plugin) for more information.
