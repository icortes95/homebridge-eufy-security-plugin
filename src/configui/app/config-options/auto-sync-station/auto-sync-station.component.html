      When enabled, all alarm and change modes of all devices will be removed and replaced by a single new Alarm/Mode
      feature which will sync every mode together. Furthermore, this synchronization will exclusively occur through
      Apple HomeKit; syncing won't apply if changes are made using the Eufy App.
